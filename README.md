This is a pomodoro timer for use in improving work habits. When started, it counts down for 25 minutes (work time), then sounds an alarm, then counts down from 5 minutes (break time), then sounds another alarm, then repeats the process.

I paired on this project with dyskgo. Thanks for all of their work!

Update: There are now three time interval options: 25/5, 45/15, and 50/10 (work time / break time).
Special thanks to Cat Queen for adding this multiple time interval functionality!
