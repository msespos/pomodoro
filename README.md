This is a pomodoro timer for use in improving work habits. When started, it counts down for 25 minutes (work time), then sounds an alarm, then counts down from 5 minutes (break time), then sounds another alarm, then repeats the process.

I paired on this project with dyskgo. Thanks for all of their work!
